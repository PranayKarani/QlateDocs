**Privacy Policy**

Qlate is a combination of a notepad and a calculator enabling users to write and evaluate dynamic calculations in the form of Sheets.
All the Sheets are saved locally on the user's device and not uploaded to any backend server or shared with any third-party service in any way by the app. The app does not need an internet connection for its usage except to serve Ads on the free version.

Qlate records and shares usage analytics using [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics). These metrics are completely anonymous and generalized. They are implemented to improve user experience and are not used to track the user or serve advertisements in any way. Users can opt-out of the analytics anytime from the settings page on the app.

Qlate uses [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/) for error and crash reporting. This cannot be disabled by the user since it greatly helps the developer to make the app technically stable.

The free version of the app is supported by Ads from various Ad networks through an Ad mediation.
